Why would you need a thigh massage? Well, your legs are one of the body parts with the highest usage but are unfortunately taken for granted because they are constantly there when we need to use them. A good thigh massage will give your legs the much-needed attention and help alleviate pain and discomfort associated with overuse.

Massage in Cape Town is becoming a [common practice](/top-massage-parlours-in-cape-town/) and more and more masseuse are specializing in different forms of massage therapy. Any proficient therapists will have adequate training to give you a thigh massage that will give your legs and body support. It can help not only relax your muscles but strengthen them making walking and other activities much easier to perform.

A good thigh massage will alleviate circulation issues that you might have and if they are not serious, you might actually not need any medical attention after the massage. Massage in Cape Town for your thighs is performed by licensed therapists.

Thigh massage is made up of a sequence of strokes that are applied in a rhythmic manner all across the thighs and legs.  The techniques employed are categorized as petrissage, effleurage, and friction or medium, light and deep.

When massaging thighs, massage therapists will want to cover the outer thigh, inner thigh as well as hamstrings. A masseuse may also change stance so as to give a more effective massage.


## The Strokes


Strokes used during a thigh massage in Cape Town should not be too light because then the tension is not released in the muscles adequately. Strokes that are too deep on the other hand will only leave you in pain.

The massage should begin with strokes that are light gliding and performed with flats of the hands. Hands should also be molded into the shape of the legs and swept up, down, and outside of the thighs. Pressure should be applied in varying degrees checking to ensure the individual is not in discomfort or pain.


## Outer Thighs


Effleurage and petrissage techniques are employed in the out thigh massage. Medium strokes that include kneading are great for the fleshy large muscles in the outer thigh. A therapist is likely to press in their thumbs grabbing the muscles with their fingers and rolling the flesh towards the thumb. As the stroke ends with one hand a similar movement is started with the other. This establishes rhythm through alternating of the hands. Tender spots such as the back of the knee should be completely avoided.


## Inner Thighs


For inner thighs, light strokes are applied using the hand's heel, and in the direction of your pelvis. The massage Cape Town therapist will most likely bend their elbows to form circular position which will help in evening out the depth and pressure of strokes applied. Since the inner thigh is more sensitive than the outer one, you should avoid application of sudden or too much pressure. The therapist also reverses the stroke by changing positions.


## Back Of Thighs


For inner thighs, light strokes are applied using the hand's heel, and in the direction of your pelvis. The massage Cape Town therapist will most likely bend their elbows to form circular position which will help in evening out the depth and pressure of strokes applied. Since the inner thigh is more sensitive than the outer one, you should avoid application of sudden or too much pressure. The therapist also reverses the stroke by changing positions.


## Finishing the Massage


As the massage comes to an end, you should expect pressure to reduce as well on the strokes that are applied. Your therapist will use strokes such as rocking and releasing strokes to aid in releasing residual tension that could be present in the thigh muscles. By rocking the upper leg muscles, the masseuse might place their hands on either side of the thighs and gently rock the legs.  They may alternate the rocking movement down your leg, all the way to the ankle. This is done to help relax your joints.
