Discussing some tips on how prepare for an erotic massage.

**Before:**

_Take a warm shower_ – It is important that you be clean and relaxed during your massage. Before your massage take a [warm shower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKErf2AipLs) to help loosen up your muscles and thoroughly clean your body.

_Right mindset_ – If you find that you are nervous, take some time to [meditate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoFgQ9bCovc) before your appointment. You don’t want to be antsy or mentally unavailable during your massage as this will take away from the experience.

_Don’t eat too much_ – While you don’t want to be hungry, you also don’t want to be uncomfortably full. It’s okay to eat a small snack before your appointment, but don’t gorge on a three-course meal! If you wish to achieve a squirting orgasm, water will assist with this technique. One liter of water will help so be sure to drink lots of water.

_Communicate with the therapist_ – When you call to make your appointment Ian Marshall, the male therapist in Cape Town, will ask you a list of questions. Be sure to answer honestly and give as much detail as necessary. Communicating with your massage therapist will ensure that you receive a personalized service. When you prepare for an erotic massage, ask him many questions as well. So you know, more or less what to expect. Sometimes not all the information is on the website.

**During:**

Be on time – Running late can put you in an antsy and rushed mindset. Be certain that you give yourself enough time to get ready for and arrive at your appointment on time. You don’t want to feel frazzled at the beginning of your appointment!

Relax body and mind – To get the most out of your massage, try to relax. Having tense muscles can make the massage painful while having your mind on grocery shopping can take away from the experience.

Stay alert – That is not to say you should drift off! Relax your muscles and don’t go over your to-do list for tomorrow. But do be in the moment and aware of what is going on. It’s important that you focus on the sensations you are experiencing to get the most out of your massage.

Communicate with the therapist – Before your appointment, you gave detail about what you want and need. Now you need to be honest about what feels good, what you like, and if your needs change. This service is all about you, and you shouldn’t be afraid to speak up!

**After:**

_Drink water ­_– Some of the oils used by massage therapists can have a “detoxing” quality. This means that it can cause [dehydration](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0d/f6/21/0df621f72bd1e8437c30b1c7eef78b6b.jpg). Be sure to drink plenty of water after your appointment.

Snack – Since you probably didn’t eat much before your appointment, use the time afterward to eat something! Again, don’t stuff yourself, because you want to [feel good](/exclusive-interview-with-ian-marshall/). But do eat if you are feeling hungry.

Set up a future appointment – If you enjoyed yourself and would like to experience a erotic massage again, take some time to set up your [next appointment](/faq/). Next time you will know for sure how to prepare for an erotic massage.
