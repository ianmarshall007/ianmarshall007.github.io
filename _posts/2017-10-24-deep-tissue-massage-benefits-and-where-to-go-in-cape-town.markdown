## What is Deep Tissue Massage?


As the name suggests, deep tissue massage applies deep pressure onto specific trouble points. It feels very much like someone is torturing you on purpose by pushing into your knotted muscle, and the massage can leave you feeling sore. There is more pressure all over your body where as erotic massage is with a more gentle and relaxing touch. Deep Tissue massage are designed for specific points on the body and not usually the full body which is very much similar to [Sports Massage](/sports-massage-cape-town/).

A [Swedish massage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage#Swedish_massage) is a full-body relaxing massage. Swedish massage focuses on smooth, slow, gliding strokes, and is meant for relaxation. A [deep tissue massage](http://fb101massage.com/descriptions.html) may not be a full-body massage. The therapist will focus first on the areas that you say need lots of attention: areas of chronic pain and tightness, limited mobility, old injuries, etc., working with deeper tissue layers to release adhesions, reduce scar tissue, lengthen muscles and fascia, etc. Deep tissue massage is heavier, more focused, and more intense, It is used more for working out muscle knots and for helping release spasms.
