Kamasutra is also known as the Kama Sutra in the Western side of the world. The erotic tantra Kama Sutra book deals with human sexual behavior. This is not an ordinary book, this is a book on the art of [sexual science](/orgasms-and-relaxation/) which formed the basis for Tantra Massage. The various sexual positions used in both tantra massage and Kama Sutra are explained in a detailed way. [This book](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/positions/) helps you boost the confidence when having intimate moments with your partner or spouse. In general, you will have a much happier sex life without the 'boring' in it. [Sex love and positions](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/positions/) for detailed explanations and images. The book to me is known as the words of love. The music is known as the sounds of love.

After you heard about the sounds of love, lets delve more into words of love. [Vatsyayana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%81tsy%C4%81yana) has taken work from previous authors and compiled his own book called the Kama Sutra. About seven chapters of the book were part of longer works by Dattaka, Suvarnanabha, Ghotakamukha, Gonardiya, Gonikaputra, Charayana and Kuchumara. The latest version of the Kama Sutra has 1250 verses that is distributed in 36 chapters and is organised into seven parts.

**1) General remarks**
