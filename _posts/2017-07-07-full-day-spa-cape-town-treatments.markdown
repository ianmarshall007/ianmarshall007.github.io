There are a few massage full or half day spa Cape Town treatments. The places I liked are the places where you have to take a long drive to get to. In other words it feels like a short road trip.

Most of them are on the Winelands with great greenery as well as scenery. With views of the mountain in the foreground, you can walk through the green gardens and look at the most beautiful statues and sculptures while having your food or tea break.

## Rogue Day Spa


They are a health and beauty spa based in the southern suburbs of Cape Town. Their environment, whilst being professional and service orientated, is also wonderfully casual and comfortable. In summer, their guests are encouraged to relax on the sun deck, enjoy the salt water swimming pool and tanning loungers. In winter they offer a cosy lounge area complete with fire place and wifi facilities for them to enjoy before or after your treatments.

## The Spa at Leeu Estates


Set among the vineyards, Leeu Spa is a wellness sanctuary that offers authentic massages and holistic treatments by expert therapists. These hand-picked treatments are inspired by centuries-old Asian traditions. Using wild-harvested organic ingredients from remote, untainted regions such as the Amazon rain forest and the Himalayas, the hand-blended ila product range utilised in the treatments harnesses natural healing energy.

While there are many spa Cape Town treatments inside or outside the city. I have not given all of them a try. For a Sensual Nude and Erotic Massage for Women, book a Cape Town massage with [Ian Marshall](/exclusive-interview-with-ian-marshall/).
