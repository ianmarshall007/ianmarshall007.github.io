What massage oils to use for a sensual massage can truly help set the mood. You will want to choose a proper base for the type of massage you plan to give. For deep tissue or reflexology massages you will want a heavy massage oil, but for a sensual massage you’ll want a lighter base to help your hands glide across the skin of the recipient.

### Base:


Almond massage oil is a great choice because it isn’t greasy and easily absorbs into the skin. It doesn’t absorb too quickly, making it great for spreading about before hydrating the skin. It is light and leaves the skin feeling silky smooth! Not only does it moisturize the skin, it also helps with irritation, inflammation and itching.
Grape-seed massage oil also is not greasy and is a fantastic moisturizer. It aides in tightening the pores and can be used to combat acne, wrinkles, and other skin conditions. This is a popular choice as it leaves the recipient looking and feeling younger.
Coconut oil is clean and colorless. When it is heated it liquefies into a smooth pleasant smell.
Olive oil is heavier and therefore does not work as well for sensual massage. But it aides with dehydration and inflammation. It can be mixed with other oils to enrich the qualities.
Any vegetable oil, except peanut or corn oil is good to use after it gets heated.
