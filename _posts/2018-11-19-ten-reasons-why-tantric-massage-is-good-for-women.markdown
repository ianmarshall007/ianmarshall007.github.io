Tantric massage has been around for in both western and eastern parts of the world to assist with revitalizing the soul, body and mind. Many of the [massage types](/difference-between-sensual-erotic-tantra-and-happy-ending-massages/) have traced to thousands of years, they used it to remove pain from the body, mind and soul. While many would disagree, I believe that Tantric massage is good for women because it was designed specifically for women.

Every type of massage was each created to eliminate different pains in the body. Whether you have a [neck problem](/the-benefits-of-neck-massage/), there is a certain type of massage for you. If you injured yourself while playing soccer, a [sports massage](/sports-massage-cape-town/) would be good for you. This will leave you more content and happier in your day to day everyday life.

The numerous benefits that is has on health can leave many of us breathless. Some people still do not have faith in [tantric massage](/what-exactly-is-tantra-massage/). They think it brings no effect to health and spirit as well as that it is a bunch of marketing tactics. This is not true, thousands of year’s people have been using this technique to cure people from pain.

The whole point of receiving a massage is to reduce the stress inside the body, clear aches, muscle tension and pain. Some experts claim that tantric massage is able to remove symptoms of certain chronic illnesses and diseases.

Below are the ten main reasons why tantric massage is good for women.


## Relieves stress


Stress is not only emotional but also physical. It is important to take care of your full body. Women love massage and which makes massage a perfect medicine for stress relief.


## Relieves aches and pains


Since women have joined the workforce, they are too are now standing on their feet whole day. If not, sitting in front of a computer. Feet as well as neck can be rather painful after a long day at work. Since Tantric massage was designed for removing pain from the body, mind and soul. This makes it the perfect massage therapy.


## Makes your more relaxed


There is no better way to treat and relax your body other than a full body Tantric massage. If you are at a pool or resort chilling in a bathing suit lying down, there is nothing to ease your blood flow. This is where a Tantric massage would help tremendously.


## Faster blood circulation


The movement of the hands of the massage therapist on your body makes the blood flow faster while in an idle position. What is better is using a [male massage therapist](/why-male-massage-therapists-provide-a-different-experience-to-massage/) to your full advantage.


## Assists with better sleeping patterns


A benefit that is rarely spoken of is that Tantric massage makes you sleep better. If you suffering from lack of sleep, stress or depression then Tantric massage is your medicine.


## Improve the sexual drive


With the use of soft and slow touches on the skin, it can gradually improve the sexual energy drive in women. Tantric massage is also famous for intimacy between partners that have been lost. While you could just order a classy sexy looking dildo from [an adult store](/best-adult-sex-shops-in-cape-town/), getting a massage from a [professional male massage therapist](/exclusive-interview-with-ian-marshall/) with years of experience is completely different.


## Self-Awareness and Awakening


Tantric massage is to awaken the inner soul and submit yourself spiritually to another person. It is recommended that you have positive sexual energy in your life and get everybody around you to have it as well. To free you up and be more genuine in this world.


## Sex Education


During any sexual massage, the massage therapist explains exactly where he is going to touch. He explains some theory for how it all happens. This is a great way of learning more about sexual education.


## Sequential Stronger Orgasms


Experience orgasms that are different from your usual day to day orgasm. It’s from a professional who has done this for years. I will explain all the different types of orgasms out there, from the famous to the unknown types of orgasms. The main aim of Tantric massage is not to achieve an orgasm, but rather the journey to achieving an orgasm.


## Control Impulses


The breathing techniques used in Tantric massage will help you control your body in a more natural way.

Tantric massage is good for women because it focuses on stimulating the nerves positioned in your sexual organs to create new pathways of sensation to the brain. In other words, it is about removing the block in the your fantastic body to open the way for more erotic energy to make way. This will in turn free you up to be more expressive, turned on, happier and alive in this world.

Since you might be thinking of a new way to get pampered, or perhaps want to experience a [different kind of orgasm](/the-6-types-of-female-orgasms/) then book an appointment.
