Vanessa who is a Sexologist paid an expert to massage her vagina in an erotic massage technique. The sexologist recommends erotic massage. Like all clients, Vanessa was also nervous in the beginning. This then ended up being one of her most powerful experiences of her life. Her friends and family still does not believe that she paid an expert to massage her vagina. A tantric massage practitioner usually refers to vagina as Yoni. The word Yoni comes from the [Sanskrit dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) and is also sometimes referred to as the sacred cave.

She needed to explore different therapies for her to report back to her clients. The [vagina massage](/the-benefits-of-vagina-massage/) also releases tension in the body as in any other part of the body from a [different sort of massage](/different-types-of-massages-to-find-in-cape-town/).  A person who is interested in getting an erotic massage should get recommended from somebody who has been before. She still can't believe the fact that she had paid somebody to go to her to her hotel room to massage her vagina.

On her journey to erotic massage she has learned the following important factors:




  * There is a strong focus on healing and holding space for whatever emotions come up so these can be felt and experienced.


  * The intention of the massage is for healing, awakening and transformation.


  * Clear intentions for both the receiver and the giver.


  * Clear communication about boundaries and sensation.


She noted that it is important for women to get massaged on their vagina because when the tension gets released there is more space for creativity and confidence. The erotic massage always starts with a full-body oil massage. There is no touching of the genitalia until you are fully relaxed. She is not the only sexologist who recommends erotic massage.

A 2002 study from the State University of New York suggested that regular exposure to semen reduced the incidence of depression among 293 women. Connecting with your partner through sex also helps shield you from life’s emotional blows. “During times of anxiety, you won’t feel as estranged from each other,” says the Calgary sexologist Trina Read. “It’s easier to ride out the bad patches.”

According to Daniel Amen, MD, author of _Sex on the Brain_, nutmeg is used in Indian medicine to [boost the libido](/sensual-erotic-massage-to-boost-your-libido/). In one study, researchers also found that nutmeg had the same effect on lab rats as Viagra.
