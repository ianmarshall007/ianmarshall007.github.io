Whether you are male or female reading this, when it comes to sexually pleasuring a woman you need to know the vagina. The vagina is one of the worlds most complicated topics. Every woman is different and so is every vagina different. Whoever claims that a vagina is the same on all women, that person is completely wrong. Every vagina has different senses, texture, feel and touch to it. Some is strong while others are weak. I have discussed before the benefits of [massaging a vagina](/the-benefits-of-vagina-massage/). This article I will go through the basic theory behind the vagina anatomy.


## Clitoris


The clitoris has about 8000 nerve endings that services the pelvic region. From this one sentence you should be able to know that most women can get a clitoris orgasm from [stimulation](/three-ways-to-have-strong-female-orgasms/). It is the only organ on the female body solely built for sexual pleasure. The clitoris consists of the following:




  * Clitoral glans or shaft: This is where most of the nerves connect the clitoris to the vagina and it all ends in the glans.


  * Clitoral hood: An outgrowth that protects the clitoral glans. The glans go forward from the clitoral hood when a woman is aroused.


  * Crura: Runs back to the pubic bone and located to the right and left of the urethra. The two internal portions of the clitoris are connected and shaped as a V.


  * Clitoral bulbs: These bulbs extend down beneath the Labia Minora. These bulbs gets filled with blood vessels when a woman gets aroused which makes the vulva swell.


  * Front commissure: Above the base of the clitoral shaft, beneath where the labia majoras meet. This is sensitive and often quite overlooked.


  * Fourchette: Bottom edges of the lips below the vaginal starting point and is close to the perineum.




## Vulva


The vulva is the whole area or system of the female genitalia. The vulva is made up of the following on the vagina anatomy:




  * Labia Majora: In plain English, this is the large outer lips that is very sensitive and protects the inner layer of the vulva.


  * Labia Minora: The minora is the smaller inner lips which swells and changes colour when a woman becomes sexually aroused. This is slender in size than the outer lips.


  * Mons Veneris: This spot is soft and on top of the pubic bone that is sensitive to touch and brilliant for arousal.

## G-Spot


Many women say they are not able to find their g-spot. The only way to find it is by inserting two fingers inside the vagina and perform the come hither motion. The g-spot is a spongy tissue about 3 - 6 cm up inside the vagina. This spot is notably known for giving women intense g-spot orgasms. I wrote a previous article on [stimulating the g-spot effectively](/how-to-properly-stimulate-the-g-spot/).


## Cervix


Cervix is the narrow end of the uterus that connects it with the top of the vagina. When she is aroused the cervix expands and gets slightly hard. This is where women can receive physical and emotional release. More information can be read at [Web MD Anatomy for vagina](https://www.webmd.com/women/picture-of-the-vagina#1).


## Urethra


Urethral opening is where the urine leaves the body of a woman. There is a small little piece of tissue on both sides of the opening that is very sensitive when touched. This spot is known as the U-spot, this spot is apparently difficult to find for some.

## Bartholin's Gland


When a woman is sexually aroused, she secretes small quantities of lubrication from the Bartholin's Gland. The gland is located slightly below the vaginal opening.


## Skene's Glands


The Skene's glands are behind the back wall of the vagina and at the lower end of the urethra. The glans swell with blood vessels when a woman is fully aroused.

Women should not be [struggling with achieving orgasms](/why-women-struggle-with-orgasms/) if their partner knows the basics of vagina anatomy.
