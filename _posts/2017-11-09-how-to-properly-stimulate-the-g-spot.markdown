When you look at the below diagram, the g-spot is about 5 cm inside the vagina. The g-spot is usually softer than any other part of the vagina. To find your G Spot with your fingers, just slide your palm down your stomach, with your palm touching your stomach, all the way down to your vagina. Then enter your vagina with 1 or 2 fingers and curl those fingers backward once they are 2-3 inches deep inside you. You should now be able to stimulate the G-Spot on your fingertips.
